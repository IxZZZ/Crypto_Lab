Code DES and AES with library cryptopp
Task 1: Coding DES, AES using cryptopp library
Required:
+) Plaintext:  

    - Input from screen;
    
    - Support Vietnamse (using setmod, UTF-16)
    
+) Mode of operations:

  - Select mode from screen (using switch case)
  - Support modes:  ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR, XTS, CCM, GCM.
+) Secret key and Initialization Vector (IV) select from screen (using switch case)

  Case 1: Secret key and IV are randomly chosen for each run time using random generator using CryptoPP::AutoSeededRandomPool;
  
  Case 2: Input Secret Key and IV from screen
  
  Case 3: Input Secret Key and IV from file
  
 +) OS platform
  - Your code can compile on both Windows and Linux;
+) Performance

  - Report your hardware resources
  - Report computation performance for all operations on both Windows and Linux
